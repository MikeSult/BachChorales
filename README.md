Uses lilyPondAdapter to bridge the Tone.js and lilyPond functionality.
BachChorales.js contains javascript objects containing the lilypond text for
the Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass parts to each of the 371 chorales composed
by J.S.Bach.  These works are still used to teach analysis and 4-part writing
skills for music students.
